- goto chest outside the map, got the some pieces of the base64 flag, this game have 4 pieces of flag

![image](https://github.com/0hanif0/WGMY2023CTF-Writeups/assets/23289982/c23f2047-0852-40b4-9ccf-db8b435c1c38)

- after edited the save game, download and replace the same name file, open game and load the new edited save game, and buy `Dead Sea Scroll 500000` and use the item, and got another pieces of the base64 flag

![image](https://github.com/0hanif0/WGMY2023CTF-Writeups/assets/23289982/c1a9ee9b-f13b-43c6-9d1b-d99263e3b62f)

- kill the boss, got another pieces of the base64 flag

- there are 2 part of QR, i just create

| QR 1 | QR 2 |
|------|------|
| ![qr1](https://github.com/0hanif0/WGMY2023CTF-Writeups/assets/23289982/a4f9aec3-266d-469c-b9de-6a6c5fe18d68) | ![qr2](https://github.com/0hanif0/WGMY2023CTF-Writeups/assets/23289982/7f1b3d99-6977-4bd1-b11a-7c580b47b128) |
| QR 1 = Page 1 \(Dark) \+ Page 3 \(Dark) | QR 2 = Page 2 \(Dark) \+ Page 3 \(Dark) \+ \[Page 3 \(Gray) - \[Page 3 \(Gray) âˆ© QR1 \(Dark)\]\] |
